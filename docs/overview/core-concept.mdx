The core concept of Jimmer is to read and write data structures of arbitrary shapes as a whole, rather than simply processing entity objects.

- Jimmer entity objects **are not POJOs**, and can easily <ViewMore buttonText="express data structures of arbitrary shapes" title="Flexibility of Jimmer Entities"><DynamicShape/></ViewMore>.

- Data structures of any shape can be processed as a whole for:

    - Reading: Jimmer creates this infinitely flexible data structure and passes it to you
    - Writing: You create this infinitely flexible data structure and pass it to Jimmer

Since Jimmer's design philosophy is to read and write data structures of arbitrary shapes rather than processing simple objects, how does it differ from technologies with similar capabilities?

In JPA, to control the shape of the data structure being saved, properties must be configured with `insertable`, `updatable`, or `cascade(for associations)`,
regardless of the configuration, the saved data structure is fixed; Jimmer entities are not POJOs, their data structure shapes are ever-changing,
no prior planning and design is needed, any business scenario can construct the data structure it needs and save it directly

<td>MongoDB</td>
<td>
In MongoDB, each document structure is a data island. Although MongoDB's data structure is weakly typed, from a business perspective, which data islands exist and the internal hierarchical structure of each data island need to be designed and agreed upon in advance.
Once the design and agreement are completed, the format of the entire data view is fixed and data can only be processed from a fixed perspective;
In Jimmer, the shape of the data structure does not need to be designed in advance, any business scenario can freely plan a data structure format, and read and write the corresponding data structure as a whole.

:::tip
Based on this core concept, Jimmer will bring you convenience that was previously unattainable in any technology stack, 
freeing you from dealing with tedious details and allowing you to focus on quickly implementing complex business logic.
